      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Uche Esegbue, I am a passionate man on a mission to transform
        my life via technology. I have this strong desire to build meaningful
        digital products, I joined the AltSchool School of Engineering to see my
        dream of becoming a frontend engineer come to an existence.
      </p>
      <p>
        I dropped out of the University of Port-Harcout back then in 2017 when I
        was studying Industrial Chemistry, but I am more enthusiastic about
        making a computer programme that solves real-life problems and also have
        a stable means of income along the way. Coming from a poor family
        background, Iâ€™m motivated to build a better future, not just for myself,
        but for my family and those around me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from tech, I love watching movies, football, and playing video
        games. I believe in working smart and staying focused on my goal.
